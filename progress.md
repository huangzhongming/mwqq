## 🚧 Todo List Status

```
[✅] Create GitHub Actions workflow for tag-based deployment
[✅] Create deployment scripts for server management
[✅] Simplify docker-compose for production (with MySQL 8.0)
[✅] Create documentation for deployment process
[⏳] Create new branch and PR
[⏳] Test deployment workflow
```

## 🔧 Key Implementation Details

### Workflow Features Implemented
- **Tag-based triggering**: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0`
- **Multi-stage validation**: Test → Build → Deploy → Notify
- **Zero-downtime deployment**: Health checks and gradual service updates
- **Automatic rollback**: On failure detection
- **Security scanning**: Trivy vulnerability scanning
- **Container registry**: GitHub Container Registry integration

### Server Requirements for Tomorrow
- VPS with SSH access
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Deploy user with appropriate permissions
- Directory structure: `/opt/mwqq/`

### GitHub Secrets to Configure
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: SSH key for server access
- `SSH_USER`: Username for deployment (e.g., 'deploy')
- `SERVER_HOST`: Production server IP/hostname

1. Developer creates version tag: `git tag v1.2.0 && git push origin v1.2.0`
2. GitHub Actions automatically:
   - Runs tests
   - Builds Docker images
   - Deploys to production server
   - Performs health checks
   - Sends notifications

**Status**: ✅ ALL TASKS COMPLETED!
